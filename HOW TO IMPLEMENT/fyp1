OSM OPEN STREET MAP

openstreet map is a open source web based map. This project introduce by openstreet map foundation. It is a non profit organization. It is introduce in 2004. The reason we choose openstreetmap instead of google map ,openstreetmap is a opensource and free of cost used by everyone for data collection and distributin. we used OSM to generate a real time scenerio of roads, vehicles, traffic lights etc. It can generate a sumoconfiguration file.



sumo simulator:

• Simulation of Urban Mobility
– An open-source traffic simulator
– Supports traffic flow and individual vehicles

• Simulate traffic flow and vehicle movement
– Support different kinds of vehicles and lanes
– Support signal control and priority
– Graphic interface
– Multi-level output (network, lane, vehicle, detector)
• Import road network
– Manually design
– Import from OpenStreetMap
• Routing

NS 3  introduction

--------------------------------------------------------
 The ns3 Simulator is a descrete event  network simulator  targeted primarily  for Research and Education purpose used

 Ns3 is a open source and free

 NS3 is not a backward compatible extension of ns2

 it is the news simulator some model of of NS2 have already imported from ns2 to ns3

NS3 is design as a set of libraries that can be combined together and also with other external software libraries 

several external animator and data analysis and visualisation tools used with ns3. however users should expect to work at the command line with the C plus plus for Python software development tools

 ns3 is primarily used for use on Linux although support accept for free PSD for for Windows 

Nf3 is not officially supported software product of any company

 Through NS3 we can generate trace file or packet capture  files which can understand by many





Softwares used:
ns-3.31
sumo 1.7.0 
OSM - Open street Map (osmWebWizard.py)

$] cd sumo/tools
$] python osmWebWizard.py
 
Select the cars, buses, motorcycles, etc.
and generate the scenario,
sumo-gui automatically pops up.

Step 1: Create the Sumo-gui or Sumo configuration file using the above method.
Step 2: Create the mobility.tcl
Step 3: run the ns2-mobility-trace.cc file with nodeNum, duration, logFile, etc.
Step 4: Include the NetAnim Code and run the simulation.




Step 2: Mobility.tcl file (How to create)
$] sumo -c osm.sumocfg --fcd-output trace.xml
$] cd && cd sumo/tools
$] python traceExporter.py -i trace.xml --ns2mobility-output=mobility.tcl
Now check the number of nodes in the mobility.tcl file which is very important.

Move the mobility.tcl in to the /home folder (/home/sami/)

Step 3: 
The program is already in the scratch folder.
$]cd ns-allinone-3.29/ns-3.29
$] ./waf --run "scratch/mobility-trace --traceFile=/home/sami/mobility.tcl --nodeNum=2265 --duration=100.0 --logFile=ns2-mob.log"

Step 4: include NetAnim Code

#include "ns3/netanim-module.h"


and include the following line above the Simulator::Run()

AnimationInterface anim("vehicularmobility.xml");

How to run NetAnim
$] cd 
$] cd ns-allinone-3.29/netanim-3.108/
$] ./NetAnim 

A window will be opened and select the vehicularmobility.xml and file and run the simulation.
